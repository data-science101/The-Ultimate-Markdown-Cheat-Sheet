When it comes to working with data, there are a lot of different options for markup languages. One popular option is Jupyter Notebooks, which allows for a mix of code and text. But what is the best way to format your data? Should you use Markdown or HTML?

Here we will take a look at the pros and cons of both Markdown and HTML to help you decide which is best for your needs.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is often used for formatting text. It is easy to learn and use, and it can be converted to HTML.

One of the main advantages of Markdown is that it is easy to read and write. This makes it a good choice for those who are just starting out with data analysis. It is also easy to convert Markdown to HTML, which can be helpful if you need to share your data with others.

However, there are some drawbacks to using Markdown. One is that it is not as widely supported as HTML. This means that if you are working with data that is not in a supported format, you may have to convert it to HTML before you can use Markdown. Additionally, Markdown does not support some of the more advanced features that are available in HTML.

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for the web. It is more complex than Markdown, but it is also more powerful.

One of the advantages of HTML is that it is very widely supported. This means that you can share your data with others without having to convert it to another format. Additionally, HTML supports a wide range of features, including tables, images, and multimedia.

However, there are some disadvantages to using HTML. One is that it can be more difficult to read and write than Markdown. Additionally, HTML can be more challenging to convert to other formats.

<h2 style="color:#047adb">So, which should you use?</h2>

The answer depends on your needs. If you are just starting out, Markdown may be the best choice for you. It is easy to use and can be converted to HTML. However, if you need more advanced features, HTML may be a better choice.

I will show you examples for each one.
